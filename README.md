munge
=====

A collection of tiny text filters.

## For the acme text editor

* `i+` - indent lines by one space
* `i-` - dedent lines by one space or tab
* `c`  - remove extra spaces
* `a`  - vertically align at a character (default is "&" and "\\" for latex tables.)

## Why not?

* `doppler` - ansi-color text (doppler-shifted echo? ha ha!)
